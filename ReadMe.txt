Smart Home Automation System
Description
The Smart Home Automation System is designed to provide centralized control over various home devices, including lighting, climate control, and security systems. The system is built on Python and enables users to interact with these devices through a simple console-based menu. This allows users to control device states, adjust settings like brightness and temperature, and view the current status of all connected devices.

Features
Device Control: Manage lights, climate controls, and security systems.
Lighting Controls: Turn lights on/off, adjust brightness, and change color.
Climate Control: Turn the system on/off, set temperature, adjust humidity, control fan speed, and toggle between cooling and heating modes.
Security System: Arm/disarm the system, trigger alarms, detect motion, adjust motion sensitivity, and view security logs.
Installation
To run the Smart Home Automation System, you will need Python installed on your computer. Python 3.6 or later is recommended. You can download Python from python.org.

Usage
Starting the System: Navigate to the directory containing the script and run it using Python:

Copy code
python smart_home_system.py
Navigating the Menu:

Use the numeric options to navigate the menu and interact with devices.
After selecting an option, follow the on-screen prompts to perform actions like turning devices on/off, setting parameters, or viewing logs.
Interacting with Devices:

Choose the corresponding number to interact with a specific device (Light, Climate Control, Security System).
For each device, you will have specific actions available, such as turning on/off, adjusting settings, or viewing the status.
Exiting the System:

To exit the system, select the 'Exit' option from the main menu.
Example Commands
Turn on all devices: Choose option 1 from the main menu.
Adjust light brightness: Select 4 to interact with Light, then choose 3 to set brightness.
Set climate temperature: Select 5 for Climate Control, then 3 to set the temperature.
Arm the security system: Choose 6 for Security System and select 1 to arm.
